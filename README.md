//   1  I block freely. If I don't like you and you're going against my boundaries I will not think twice. 

//  2  cuddling is accepted if you ask. (I always say yes, dont be shy just give me a heads up.) 

//  3   dont be the guy that says "omg you're my favorite character!" do not treat me like I'm fictional it's offensive. 
//   4  Alfred's playhouse fans and Nazis are another thing I'm not okay with I don't care how you justify it.
